                <li>2/3 cup milk (whole or 2 percent)</li>
                <li>3 slices of white bread, crusts removed (about 3 ounces)</li>

                <li>1/4 cup ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan or Romano cheese</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt (or 2 teaspoons kosher salt)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano or marjoram</li>
                <li>2 to 3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>About 1 cup flour, for dusting</li>
                <li>1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>2 1/2 cups (24 ounces) tomato sauce (recipe follows, or use already prepared)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>To make the meatballs, heat the milk in a small pot until steamy. Turn off the heat, tear the bread into little pieces and soak it in the milk until it partially dissolves. Mash it until you get something that resembles a paste. Turn it out onto a plate to let it cool.</li>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the beef, pork, ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan, eggs, garlic, parsley, oregano, salt, pepper, and the bread-milk mixture. Mix it well with your hands until it barely combines.</li>
                <li>Wet your hands and form the meatballs. A traditional size for this sort of meatball is 2 to 3 inches across, but you can make them any size you want.</li>
                <li>When all the meatballs are formed, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the meatballs on at least 2 sides. Don't worry about the center getting cooked through, as you will finish these in the sauce.</li>
                <li>Once all the meatballs are browned, arrange them in the sauce, turning each one over in the sauce to coat. Cover the pot and simmer gently for 15 to 20 minutes. Serve with the sauce and pasta or crusty bread. Sprinkle with a little chopped parsley for garnish if you want.</li>
            </ol>
